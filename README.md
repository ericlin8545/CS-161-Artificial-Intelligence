# CS 161: Artificial Intelligence

This course introduces the design of intelligent agents, including the fundamental problem-solving and knowledge-representation paradigms of artificial intelligence. Topics to be covered include the AI programming language LISP, state-space and problem reduction methods, brute-force and heuristic search, two-player games, and recent developments in game AI. For knowledge representation and reasoning, we will cover propositional and first-order logic and their inference algorithms. Finally, the course covers probabilistic approaches to AI, such as Bayesian networks to improve the agentâ€™s performance with experience.
